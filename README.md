# EdTech Demo

ed-tech showcase built with Strapi and Next.js (App Router)

An ed-tech showcase built with Strapi and Next.js (App Router). This project demonstrates how to power a modern learning platform with:

Strapi as a headless CMS providing structured content (courses, lessons, instructors, reviews).

Next.js App Router with a mix of server-side rendering for fast, SEO-friendly pages and client-side hydration for live updates.

Testing at multiple levels: unit, integration and a11y

Performance & Accessibility as first-class concerns, with Lighthouse integrated into the workflow.

___

Pair programming: build/extend a small feature in Next.js (App Router) with a simple Strapi data source. We’ll focus on reasoning, trade-offs, and collaboration rather than “speed typing.”

Refactor & tests: add basic tests, talk through a11y/perf considerations, light code review.

Q&A: your questions about the stack, team and role.
Wrap-up: next steps.
